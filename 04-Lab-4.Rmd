**Using R Scripts as an Alternative to RShiny**

If you are feeling ambitious and would like to try making plots, calculating descriptive statistics, and performing analyses using R instead of the RShiny App, some R scripts are provided in the [Optional Deeper Dive here](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/lab-7-activity.html) in the BIOL 116 Lab manual for your use. These scripts align with the code used to produce figures, stats, and analyses in the RShiny App. However, by using these R Scripts you can edit code to customize the outputs (ie. change the fill colour on your figure etc.). 

*Keep in mind that there will be no additional support through TA's or instructors should you choose to use these scripts.*
